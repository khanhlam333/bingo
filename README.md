# Bingo
[Bingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)) in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on cards with the numbers the game host (caller) draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card.
In my version of the game, I digitized it by printing our the "card" on screen. The player can generate a random number by pressing the `Generate Number` button. If the generated number matches with the number on the player's card, the player will tick it, and a red "X" will appear.

In this game, the player will play against a machine. Whoever gets the selected numbers arranged on the screen in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally first, will win the game.
