# Bingo
[Bingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)) is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on cards with the numbers the game host (caller) draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card.

In my version of the game, I digitized it by printing our the "card" on screen. The player can generate a random number by pressing the `Generate Number` button. If the generated number matches with the number on the player's card, the player will tick it, and a red "X" will appear.

In this game, the player will play against a machine. Whoever gets the selected numbers arranged on the screen in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally first, will win the game.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) was used to create my version of Bingo.
