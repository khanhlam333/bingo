# Bingo
[Bingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)) is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on cards with the numbers the game host (caller) draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card.

In my version of the game, I digitized it by printing out the "card" on screen. The player can generate a random number by pressing the `Generate Number` button. If the generated number matches the number on the "card", the player must tick the number, and a red `x` will appear. In this version of Bingo, the player will be playing against a machine. Whoever gets the generated numbers arranged on the screen in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally first, will win the game. 

[React](https://reactjs.org/) was used to create my version of Bingo.
